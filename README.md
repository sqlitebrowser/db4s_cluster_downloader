Just a super simple Go application, originally designed for serving
DB Browser for SQLite downloads from a small, inexpensive cluster
of servers.

Now that we're using much beefier servers, it's just running on a
single server rather than a cluster.  Can easily be thrown behind
a load balancer (etc) if the need ever arises again.
